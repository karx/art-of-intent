# Launching Art of Intent: Teaching Prompt Engineering Through Play

## The Problem I Wanted to Solve

We're living in the age of AI, where the ability to communicate effectively with language models is becoming as important as knowing how to use a search engine. But here's the thing: prompt engineering isn't intuitive. It's a skill that requires practice, experimentation, and a deep understanding of how AI interprets language.

Most tutorials are dry. Most courses are expensive. I wanted to create something different: a game that teaches prompt engineering without feeling like learning.

## Enter: Art of Intent

Art of Intent is a daily word puzzle game with a twist. You're guiding Arty, a haiku-writing bot, to speak specific target words. The catch? There's a list of forbidden words you absolutely cannot use in your prompts.

### The Core Mechanic

Each day, you get:
- **3 target words** Arty must say
- **5 blacklisted words** you cannot use
- **Unlimited attempts** (but efficiency matters!)

Your goal: Craft prompts that guide Arty to naturally use the target words in his haiku responses, all while avoiding the forbidden terms.

### Why This Works

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Every prompt gets an instant response. You see what works and what doesn't in real-time.

2. **Efficiency Matters**: The game tracks your token usage. Better prompts = fewer tokens = higher scores. This teaches you to be concise and precise.

3. **Creative Constraints**: The blacklist forces creative thinking. Can't use "ocean" to get Arty to say "wave"? Find another way!

4. **Competition**: Daily leaderboards add motivation. See how your prompt engineering skills stack up globally.

## The Technical Journey

Building this was an exercise in keeping things simple while adding depth:

### Tech Stack
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks. Just clean ES6 modules.
- **Firebase**: Authentication, Firestore for data, Analytics for insights
- **SVG Graphics**: Custom-generated share cards with DOS aesthetic
- **Jest**: Comprehensive test coverage for reliability

### Design Philosophy

I wanted the game to feel like a retro terminal application. The DOS aesthetic isn't just nostalgia—it's about focus. No distractions, just you and the puzzle.

The UI uses:
- ASCII art borders
- Monospace fonts (Courier Prime)
- Terminal-style color scheme (cyan, green, yellow on black)
- Box-drawing characters for that authentic feel

## What I Learned

### 1. Prompt Engineering is Hard
Even building a game about it, I found myself struggling with certain combinations. The blacklist mechanic really forces you to think differently about language.

### 2. Efficiency vs. Effectiveness
Early testers would write long, elaborate prompts. But the scoring system rewards brevity. This mirrors real-world AI usage—every token costs money.

### 3. Community Matters
The leaderboard transformed the game from a solo puzzle to a competitive experience. Seeing others' scores motivates improvement.

## Current Status: Alpha Release
