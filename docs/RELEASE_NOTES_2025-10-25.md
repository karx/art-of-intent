## What's New

### 🖥️ Desktop: Smart Sidebar
- **Collapsible left sidebar** - Stays out of your way, expands when needed
- **Auto-hide top bar** - Disappears when scrolling, maximizes game space
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - Navigate without lifting your hands
- **Hover to peek** - Quick access without commitment

### 📱 Mobile: Intelligent Top Bar
- **Auto-hide navigation** - More vertical space for gameplay
- **Icon + label design** - Clear, no guessing what buttons do
- **Optimized for thumbs** - Easy reach, comfortable tapping
- **Smooth animations** - Polished, professional feel

### 👤 Know Who's Playing
- **User indicator in input area** - See your identity where you type
- **Real-time updates** - Changes instantly when signing in/out
- **Terminal aesthetic** - `> Username` prompt style

## Why These Changes?

### Cognitive Design Principles

**Fitts's Law**
- Sidebar at screen edge = infinite width = faster clicks
- Larger touch targets on mobile = easier tapping

**Miller's Law**
- 5-7 navigation items = optimal working memory load
- Grouped by function (play, monitor, configure)

**Progressive Disclosure**
- Navigation hidden during active gameplay
- Appears when needed (scroll to top)
- Reduces distractions, maintains flow state

**Jakob's Law**
- Familiar patterns (VSCode-style sidebar)
- Users already know how it works
- Zero learning curve

---

## Technical Highlights

- **7 files changed** - 1,288 additions, 92 deletions
- **60fps animations** - Smooth, performant transitions
- **Responsive breakpoint** - 767px for mobile/desktop split
- **Accessibility first** - ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- **Comprehensive docs** - Full design rationale documented

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+B` | Toggle sidebar |
| `F1` | Help |
| `Ctrl+L` | Leaderboard |
| `Ctrl+P` | Profile |
