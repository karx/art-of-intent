**Changes:**
```javascript
// Before: Modern styled modal with emojis
modalTitle.textContent = 'üéâ Victory!';

// After: DOS-styled modal
modalTitle.textContent = 'VICTORY!';
// With ASCII progress bars and bordered stats box
```

**Files Modified:**
- `game.js` - `showGameOverModal()` function

**Solution:**
- Added ASCII-formatted share text with box-drawing characters
- Added three share options:

### 3. Text-to-Speech for Voice Input ‚úÖ

**Issue:** Voice input responses weren't read back to user

**Solution:**
- Implemented Web Speech API text-to-speech
- Tracks when voice input is used
- Automatically reads Arty's response aloud
- Only activates for voice-initiated prompts

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Track voice input usage
let lastInputWasVoice = false;

// TTS function
function speakText(text) {
    const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(text);
    utterance.rate = 0.9; // Slightly slower for clarity
    window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
}

// In processResponse()
if (lastInputWasVoice) {
    speakText(responseText);
    lastInputWasVoice = false;
}
```

**Features:**
- Automatic activation when voice input is used
- Cancels previous speech before starting new
- Optimized speech rate for clarity (0.9x)
- Resets flag after each use

**Files Modified:**
- `game.js` - Added TTS functions and voice tracking

---

### 4. Leaderboard Firebase Query Fix ‚úÖ

**Issue:** Leaderboard not showing any data

**Root Cause:**
- Firebase composite indexes not deployed
- Queries with multiple `where()` and `orderBy()` clauses require indexes
- Firestore was rejecting queries without proper indexes

**Solution:**
- Simplified Firebase queries to avoid index requirements
- Moved filtering and sorting to client-side
- Increased query limits to get more data for client-side processing
- Added comprehensive error logging

**Before (Required Indexes):**
```javascript
const q = query(
    sessionsRef,
    where('gameDate', '==', today),
    where('success', '==', true),
    orderBy('totalTokens', 'asc'),
    limit(10)
);
```

**After (No Indexes Required):**
```javascript
const q = query(
    sessionsRef,
    where('gameDate', '==', today),
    limit(50)
);

// Filter and sort client-side
const sessions = snapshot.docs
    .map(doc => ({ id: doc.id, ...doc.data() }))
    .filter(session => session.success === true)
    .sort((a, b) => (a.totalTokens || 0) - (b.totalTokens || 0))
    .slice(0, 10);
```

**Benefits:**
- Works immediately without index deployment
- More flexible filtering
- Better error handling
- Console logging for debugging

**Files Modified:**
- `ui-components.js` - All three leaderboard functions:
  - `getDailyLeaderboard()`
  - `getWeeklyLeaderboard()`
  - `getAllTimeLeaderboard()`

- Rate: 0.9 (slightly slower for clarity)
- Pitch: 1.0 (normal)
- Volume: 1.0 (maximum)
- Cancels previous speech before starting

### Leaderboard Optimization

**Client-Side Processing:**
- Reduces Firebase query complexity
- No index deployment required
- More flexible filtering logic
- Better error handling

**Performance:**
- Queries up to 100 documents
- Filters in memory (fast)
