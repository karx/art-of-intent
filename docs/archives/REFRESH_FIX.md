# Page Refresh Fix
## Share Buttons Persist After Refresh

---

## Issue

When game ends and input morphs to share buttons, refreshing the page would show the input section again instead of the share buttons.

## Root Cause

The `morphInputToShare()` function was only called from `showGameOverModal()`, which doesn't run on page refresh. The game state was correctly saved (including `gameOver` flag), but the UI wasn't updated to reflect the game-over state.

## Solution

Added check in `initializeGame()` to morph input section if game is already over:

```javascript
function initializeGame() {
    const today = new Date().toDateString();
    
    // ... existing initialization code ...
    
    updateUI();
    
    // Check if game is already over and morph input to share buttons
    if (gameState.gameOver) {
        morphInputToShare();
    }
}
```

## Flow

### First Time Game Ends
1. User completes game (win or loss)
2. `handleGameWin()` or `handleBlacklistViolation()` sets `gameState.gameOver = true`
3. `showGameOverModal()` is called
4. `morphInputToShare()` is called from modal
5. Input section transforms to share buttons
6. Game state saved to localStorage

### After Page Refresh
1. Page loads
2. `initializeGame()` runs
3. `loadSavedGame()` restores state (including `gameOver = true`)
4. `updateUI()` updates all UI elements
5. **NEW:** Check if `gameOver` is true
6. **NEW:** If true, call `morphInputToShare()`
7. Share buttons appear instead of input section

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Win Condition
1. Play game until you win
2. Verify input morphs to share buttons
3. Refresh page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. ✅ Share buttons should still be visible
5. ✅ Input section should not appear

### Test Case 2: Loss Condition
1. Play game until blacklist violation
2. Verify input morphs to share buttons
3. Refresh page
4. ✅ Share buttons should still be visible
5. ✅ Input section should not appear

### Test Case 3: Mid-Game Refresh
1. Start game but don't finish
2. Refresh page
3. ✅ Input section should be visible
4. ✅ Share buttons should not appear
5. ✅ Game state should be preserved

### Test Case 4: New Day
1. Complete game today
2. Wait until midnight (or change system date)
3. Refresh page
4. ✅ New game should start
5. ✅ Input section should be visible
6. ✅ Previous game state should be cleared

## Files Modified

- `game.js` - Added game-over check in `initializeGame()`

## Code Changes

```diff
function initializeGame() {
    const today = new Date().toDateString();
    
    // Check if we need to generate new words for today
    const savedDate = localStorage.getItem('gameDate');
    if (savedDate !== today) {
        generateDailyWords();
        resetGameState();
        localStorage.setItem('gameDate', today);
        trackEvent('session_start', { reason: 'new_day' });
    } else {
        loadSavedGame();
        trackEvent('session_resume', { 
            attempts: gameState.attempts,
            matchedWords: gameState.matchedWords.size 
        });
    }
    
    updateUI();
+   
+   // Check if game is already over and morph input to share buttons
+   if (gameState.gameOver) {
+       morphInputToShare();
+   }
}
```

## Related Functions

### morphInputToShare()
- Replaces input section HTML with share buttons
- Wires up event listeners for share actions
- Maintains DOS aesthetic
- Shows "Come back tomorrow" message

### showGameOverModal()
- Displays game over modal
- Calls `morphInputToShare()` for first-time game end
- Shows final statistics

### loadSavedGame()
- Restores game state from localStorage
- Includes `gameOver` flag
- Preserves all game progress

## Edge Cases Handled

1. ✅ **Multiple Refreshes**: Share buttons persist across multiple refreshes
2. ✅ **Browser Back/Forward**: State maintained in navigation
3. ✅ **New Tab**: Each tab has independent state (localStorage is per-origin)
4. ✅ **Midnight Rollover**: New game starts, input section restored
5. ✅ **Clear Storage**: Game resets, input section appears

## Performance Impact

- Minimal: Single boolean check on page load
- No additional API calls
- No additional DOM queries
- Reuses existing `morphInputToShare()` function
