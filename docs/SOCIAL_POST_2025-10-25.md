üé® Excited to share: Art of Intent's navigation redesign!

We've applied cognitive psychology principles to create a more intuitive experience:

**Desktop:**
‚Ä¢ Collapsible sidebar (Fitts's Law - edge targets)
‚Ä¢ Auto-hide top bar (Progressive Disclosure)
‚Ä¢ Keyboard shortcuts for power users

**Mobile:**
‚Ä¢ Auto-hide top navigation (maximize vertical space)
‚Ä¢ Icon + label design (reduce cognitive load)
‚Ä¢ Optimized for thumb reach

**Key Principles Applied:**
‚úì Fitts's Law - Target acquisition
‚úì Miller's Law - Cognitive load (5-7 items)
‚úì Jakob's Law - Familiar patterns
‚úì Progressive Disclosure - Hide complexity

The result? Navigation that feels natural, stays out of your way during gameplay, and appears exactly when needed.

Built with: Cognitive Design + Modern Web Standards

**Title:** Redesigned navigation using cognitive design principles - Art of Intent

**Body:**

Hey everyone! Just shipped a complete navigation redesign for Art of Intent (an AI prompt engineering game) and wanted to share the cognitive design approach.

**The Challenge:**
- Game needs focus (minimal distractions)
- Auth/settings still need to be accessible
- Different needs on mobile vs desktop

**The Solution:**

*Desktop:*
- Left sidebar (56px ‚Üí 200px collapsible)
- Auto-hide top bar on scroll
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+B, F1, etc.)

*Mobile:*
- Top bar with auto-hide
- Icon + label buttons
- Optimized for thumb reach

**Cognitive Principles Applied:**

1. **Fitts's Law** - Sidebar at screen edge = infinite width = faster clicks
2. **Miller's Law** - 5-7 nav items = optimal working memory
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Hide during gameplay, show when needed
4. **Jakob's Law** - VSCode-style sidebar (familiar pattern)

**Technical:**
- 60fps animations
- Responsive breakpoint at 767px
- Throttled scroll handlers
- Full keyboard navigation

**Results:**
- More vertical space for content
- Faster navigation (keyboard shortcuts)
- Reduced cognitive load
- Better mobile UX
