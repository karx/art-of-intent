## Persona 1: The Humble Learner

**Profile**: Someone curious about AI, wants to learn but feels intimidated. Values approachable, non-judgmental learning experiences.

**Tone**: Warm, encouraging, no pressure

### DM Template

```
Hey [Name]! 👋

I've been working on something I think you might enjoy - it's called Art of Intent.

It's a simple game where you guide an AI haiku bot using prompts. No coding, no complex setup - just you, your words, and seeing what happens.

I built it because I wanted to make prompt engineering feel less intimidating and more like... play? Like those word puzzles we used to do, but with AI.

There's no "right" way to play. Some people get strategic, others just experiment. Both are totally valid.

Would love to hear what you think if you try it:
🔗 art-of-intent.netlify.app

No pressure at all - just thought it might be your kind of thing.

[Your Name]
```

**Why it works:**
- Removes intimidation ("simple game", "no coding")
- Validates all approaches ("no right way")
- Low pressure ("no pressure at all")
- Personal touch ("I think you might enjoy")

### DM Template

```
[Name] - found something you need to see 🎯

It's called Art of Intent - basically a daily puzzle game where you're prompt engineering an AI haiku bot.

But here's what makes it interesting:
• You have target words to hit
• Forbidden words to avoid
• Token efficiency scoring
• Daily leaderboard

It's like Wordle met prompt engineering and had a baby.

The cognitive design is actually really thoughtful - auto-hide navigation, keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+B, F1, etc.), the whole UX is dialed in.

Just launched a major redesign today. You're seeing this before most people.

Try it: art-of-intent.netlify.app

Curious what strategies you'll discover. Let me know if you crack the top 10.

[Your Name]
```

**Why it works:**
- Creates FOMO ("before most people")
- Appeals to discovery ("what strategies you'll discover")
- Technical details for credibility
- Challenge element ("crack the top 10")

### DM Template

```
Hey [Name],

Wanted to share something I've been building - thought you'd appreciate the craft that went into it.

Art of Intent: a prompt engineering game disguised as a haiku puzzle.

What I'm proud of:
• Applied cognitive design principles (Fitts's Law, Miller's Law, Progressive Disclosure)
• Built responsive navigation that auto-hides on scroll
• Implemented keyboard shortcuts for power users
• DOS-themed aesthetic with Solarized color palette
• Real-time Firebase sync with offline support

It's one of those projects where the constraints made it more interesting - how do you make prompt engineering feel like play?

The answer: target words, forbidden words, token efficiency scoring, and a haiku bot with personality.

🔗 art-of-intent.netlify.app

Would genuinely love your feedback - especially on the UX decisions. Built it with the same care you put into your work.

### DM Template

```
[Name] - got a puzzle for you 🧩

Art of Intent: convince an AI haiku bot to say specific words without using forbidden words.

Sounds simple. It's not.

The bot has personality. It resists. It gets creative. Sometimes it surprises you.

Your job: craft prompts that thread the needle.

The meta-game:
• Token efficiency matters (fewer tokens = higher score)
• Daily challenges with global leaderboard
• Different strategies emerge (direct vs. indirect, context-heavy vs. minimal)

I've seen people:
- Use reverse psychology
- Create elaborate scenarios
- Go full philosophical
- Try to "jailbreak" the constraints

What's your approach?   

Try it: art-of-intent.netlify.app

Bonus: there's a voice input feature. Yes, you can literally talk to the haiku bot.

Break it. Find the edge cases. Show me what I missed.

[Your Name]
```

**Why it works:**
- Frames as a challenge ("puzzle for you")
- Hints at depth ("meta-game")
- Shows emergent behavior (different strategies)
- Invites experimentation ("break it")
- Playful tone matches persona

**Tone**: Whimsical, delightful, playful

### DM Template

```
[Name]! ✨

Made a little toy I think you'll love.

It's called Art of Intent - you get to play with an AI haiku bot named Arty.

Arty writes haikus. But here's the thing: Arty has opinions. Arty has moods. Arty sometimes does the opposite of what you ask.

Your job? Convince Arty to say specific words using only your prompts.

It's like:
🎭 Improv with an AI
🎨 Collaborative poetry
🎲 A conversation game
🧩 A gentle puzzle

There's scoring and leaderboards if you want that, but honestly? The joy is in the interaction.

Sometimes Arty surprises you with something beautiful.
Sometimes Arty is cheeky.
Sometimes you both create something neither of you expected.

It's one of those "just one more try" experiences.

Try it: art-of-intent.netlify.app

Let me know if Arty makes you smile.

[Your Name]

P.S. - There's a voice input button. You can literally talk to Arty. It's delightful.
```

**Why it works:**
- Emphasizes personality ("Arty has opinions")

## Persona 7: The Game Designer / UX Professional

**Profile**: Analyzes game mechanics, UX patterns, and design decisions. Appreciates thoughtful systems design.

**Tone**: Professional, analytical, design-focused

### DM Template

```
Hey [Name],

Wanted to get your take on something I shipped - Art of Intent.

It's a prompt engineering game, but the interesting part is the design constraints:

**Core Loop:**
1. User crafts prompt
2. AI responds with haiku
3. Check for target words (win condition)
4. Check for forbidden words (lose condition)
5. Score based on token efficiency

**Design Challenges Solved:**
• How do you make prompt engineering feel like play? → Haiku bot with personality
• How do you create replayability? → Daily challenges + leaderboard
• How do you balance accessibility vs. depth? → Simple rules, emergent complexity
• How do you handle mobile UX? → Auto-hide navigation, thumb-optimized controls

**UX Decisions:**
- Side navigation (desktop) / top bar (mobile) with auto-hide on scroll
- User identity shown in input area (context awareness)
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users (Ctrl+B, F1, Ctrl+L, Ctrl+P, Ctrl+M)
- Progressive disclosure (navigation hides during active gameplay)

**Cognitive Design:**
Applied Fitts's Law, Miller's Law, Jakob's Law, and Progressive Disclosure throughout.

Would love your professional opinion - especially on the balance between game mechanics and UX patterns.

**Profile**: Deep interest in AI, LLMs, prompt engineering. Values technical accuracy and interesting use cases.

**Tone**: Technical, intellectually curious, research-oriented

### DM Template

```
[Name],

Built something that might interest you from a prompt engineering perspective.

Art of Intent - a game that explores the challenge space of constrained prompt engineering.

**The Setup:**
- LLM (Gemini) with system instructions defining a haiku bot persona
- User must craft prompts to elicit specific words in responses
- Forbidden words create a constraint satisfaction problem
- Token efficiency adds an optimization dimension

**Interesting Emergent Behaviors:**
1. Users discover indirect prompting strategies (context over direct requests)
2. The haiku constraint creates creative pressure on the model
3. Forbidden words force semantic navigation around concepts
4. Different prompt styles yield different success rates

**Technical Implementation:**
- Real-time token counting (prompt + output)
- Firebase for persistence and leaderboard
- System instruction engineering for consistent bot personality
- Validation layer for win/lose conditions

**Research Questions It Surfaces:**
• How do constraints affect prompt effectiveness?
• What's the relationship between prompt length and success rate?
• Can users develop transferable prompt engineering skills through gameplay?
• How does the haiku format affect model behavior?

Try it: art-of-intent.netlify.app

## Persona 11: The Digital Gardener

**Profile**: Cultivates ideas, nurtures projects, values slow growth and organic discovery. Maintains digital gardens, personal wikis, or evergreen content. Believes in "learning in public" and iterative development.

**Tone**: Reflective, patient, growth-oriented, contemplative

### DM Template

```
Hey [Name],

I've been tending to a little project that feels very much in the spirit of digital gardening - thought you might appreciate it.

Art of Intent: a space where you cultivate prompts and watch what grows.

It's framed as a "game" (target words, scoring, leaderboards), but the real joy is in the practice itself. Each day, you return. Each day, you try different approaches. Each day, you learn something new about how language shapes AI responses.

**Why it resonates with digital gardening:**
• Daily practice over one-time achievement
• Iterative refinement of technique
• Learning through experimentation
• Building intuition over time
• No "perfect" solution, just exploration

Some days you'll discover a prompt pattern that works beautifully.
Some days you'll try something that completely fails.
Both are valuable. Both teach you something.

The haiku bot (Arty) is like a plant that responds differently depending on how you tend to it. Sometimes direct. Sometimes indirect. Always teaching you about the relationship between input and output.

There's a leaderboard if you want external validation, but honestly? The real growth happens in the quiet moments of "what if I tried this instead?"

🔗 art-of-intent.netlify.app

It's a small daily practice. A tiny garden to tend. A space to cultivate your understanding of how words shape AI behavior.

Would love to hear what grows for you.

[Your Name]

P.S. - I'm keeping notes on what I learn each day. Feels very much like tending a digital garden - small observations that compound over time.
```

**Why it works:**
- Uses gardening metaphors throughout ("tending", "cultivate", "grows")
- Emphasizes process over outcome
- Values learning and iteration
- Acknowledges both success and failure as valuable
- Slow, contemplative tone matches their philosophy
- Mentions note-taking (digital gardeners love documentation)
- Frames as daily practice, not one-time event

### Alternative Opening (More Poetic):

```
[Name],

You know how some projects are meant to be harvested quickly, and others are meant to be tended daily?

Art of Intent is the latter.

It's a prompt engineering game, but really it's a practice. A small ritual. A daily return to the same space to see what's different.

You guide an AI haiku bot. Three target words. Three forbidden words. Infinite approaches.

What I love: there's no "solving" it. Each day is new. Each attempt teaches you something. Your intuition grows slowly, like a plant you've been watering for months.

The game mechanics (scoring, leaderboards) are there if you want them. But the real value is in the practice itself.

It's like maintaining a digital garden, but the garden is your understanding of how language shapes AI responses.

🔗 art-of-intent.netlify.app

A small daily practice. Worth tending.

[Your Name]
```

**Why this alternative works:**
- Opens with a question that invites reflection
- More poetic, contemplative tone
- Emphasizes ritual and practice
- Acknowledges the journey over destination
- Shorter, more meditative

### Follow-up for Digital Gardeners:

```
Been thinking about your approach to [their digital garden/project].

Art of Intent has become a similar practice for me - a small space I return to daily, where I notice patterns emerging over time.

Started documenting my observations:
• How indirect prompts often work better than direct ones
• The relationship between context and specificity
• How the haiku constraint shapes responses
• Patterns in what works vs. what doesn't

It's becoming its own little knowledge garden. Thought you might appreciate that aspect of it.

No pressure to try it, but if you do, curious what patterns you notice.

[Your Name]
